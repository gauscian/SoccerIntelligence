# Ontology-Based Semantic Modeling 

After we obtain data from many sources from previous sections, we used [Karma](http://usc-isi-i2.github.io/karma/)
 to connect data with the ontology and integrate the different segments of the data into one semantic graph using the URI. 
 Ontology in itself is a logical map of the meaningful connections between the real world entities depicted in form of classes.
 Every class is defined with its properties and attributes. We use [schema.org](http://schema.org/) as an ontology for our data.
 
The output RDF files obtained from Karma is in /RDF.
